## Required Assets

### Project Logos

Before running your site, you'll need to add your project logos:

1. **Project Logo** (`assets/logos/project-logo.png`):
   - Used in the navigation bar
   - Recommended size: 200x40px (or similar aspect ratio)
   - Should work well on light backgrounds
   - PNG format with transparent background preferred

2. **Project Icon** (`assets/logos/project-icon.png`):
   - Used as the favicon/browser tab icon
   - Recommended size: 32x32px or 64x64px
   - PNG format
   - Should be recognizable at small sizes

### Sponsor Logos

If you have sponsor organizations to display in the footer:

1. **Add logo files** to `assets/logos/`:
   - Sponsor logos as needed

2. **Configure sponsors** in `_data/sponsors.yaml`

### Default Placeholder Behavior

- If logos are missing, the site will still function
- Navigation will show text-only branding
- Browser icon will use default favicon
- Footer sponsor section will be empty

### Logo Guidelines

For LBNL projects, ensure logos follow the [LBNL Visual Identity Guidelines](https://creative.lbl.gov/visual-identity/):

- Use official LBNL logos when representing Berkeley Lab
- Maintain proper spacing and proportions
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
- Consider dark mode compatibility

### Quick Logo Setup

```bash
# Add your logos
cp /path/to/your/project-logo.png assets/logos/project-logo.png
cp /path/to/your/project-icon.png assets/logos/project-icon.png

# Add sponsor logos (optional)
cp /path/to/sponsor1-logo.png assets/logos/sponsor1-logo.png
cp /path/to/sponsor2-logo.png assets/logos/sponsor2-logo.png
```

## File Structure After Setup

After running the setup script, you'll have a complete Jekyll site with:

```

## Legal/Funding Acknowledgment

The template includes a collapsible accordion in the footer for displaying funding acknowledgments and legal disclaimers, which is commonly required for research projects.

### Setup Integration

The funding acknowledgment is **configured automatically during setup**:

1. **During `./setup.sh`**: You'll be prompted to enter your funding acknowledgment text
2. **Multi-line input**: Enter your text and press Enter twice when finished
3. **Skip to disable**: Leave blank to hide the legal footer entirely
4. **Auto-mode**: Use `./setup.sh -y` to skip (disables funding acknowledgment)

### Manual Configuration

After setup, you can modify the funding acknowledgment in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
# Legal/Funding Acknowledgment (appears in footer accordion)
funding_acknowledgment: |
  This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, 
  under Contract No. DE-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX. Additional support was provided by 
  [specific funding agencies or grants - customize this text for your project].

  the United States Government. Neither the United States Government nor any 
  agency thereof, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or 
  implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy,

```

**To disable**: Comment out the entire `funding_acknowledgment:` section with `#`

### Features

    A[Research Question] --> B[Data Collection]
    B --> C[Analysis]
    C --> D[Publication]
```
````
